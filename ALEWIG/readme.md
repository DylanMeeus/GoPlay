Assembly-Like Esolang Written In Go

This esolang is written purely for fun.
I'm not sure in which direction this will develop. But these are some of the 'features':

- Interpreted language, written in Go
- Piggybacks on the datatypes of Go
- Stack-based

It is _not_ a reimplementation of assembly instructions in Go. It just resembles some of the assembly-like syntax.
It will also offer some more 'higher-level' features, like easier String handling and printing.
